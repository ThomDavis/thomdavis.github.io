title: Finding value from the process and not the outcome
---

Sometimes in projects we view the outcome as the determining factor while ignoring
the process to obtain it.

### Don't judge outcomes judge effort 

I try to help newer developers by explaining that outcomes aren't what determines
a great developer. Projects get cancelled or change all the time. Growing and
getting better as a developer means more than the outcome. There are boat loads of amazing
websites that will not get the credit they deserve.

### Focus on getting better

Learning to be adaptive is the greatest tool a developer can own. Frameworks will
be ever changing and what is standard today won't be next year. Focus on being someone
that learns from every project
