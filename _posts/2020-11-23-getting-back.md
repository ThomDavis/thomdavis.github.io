title: 2020 Getting Back to It
---

Working on deadlines for the last 5 years puts your creative side to sleep. In 2021, I 
will be working on prying back my creative side again. 

### Building something well

The word building carries a lot of meaning. It's the entire process from start to finish,
from conception to the after party. It is the trench work alongside the long term planning.
As we approach 2021 I hope to bring myself back into the fold of building again. 
Not always something software but a little of everything.
